<P><HR><CENTER><H3>Introduction</H3></CENTER>

A <EM>Longest Common Subsequence</EM> (LCS) of two strings is exactly
what the name implies!  For instance, an LCS of the strings
<TT>haedlelfog</TT> and <TT>abchxeylzloabc</TT> is the string
<TT>hello</TT>.  Note that the characters of the LCS do not need to be
contiguous in either of the original strings.  Also, there may be
multiple LCS's.

<P>

It is simple to find an LCS of two strings recursively.  Suppose
that <TT>s1</TT> and <TT>s2</TT> are strings, and <TT>c1</TT> and
<TT>c1</TT> are characters.  Define <TT>LCS(s1+c1,s2+c2)</TT> to be:
<UL>
  <LI> <TT>LCS(s1,s2)+c1</TT> if <TT>c1==c2</TT>
  <LI> <TT>LCS(s1+c1,s2)</TT> if <TT>c1!=c2</TT> and <TT>LCS(s1+c1,s2)>LCS(s1,s2+c2)</TT>
  <LI> <TT>LCS(s1,s2+c2)</TT> if <TT>c1!=c2</TT> and <TT>LCS(s1,s2+c2)>LCS(s1+c1,s2)</TT>
</UL>
Of course, <TT>LCS(s1,empty)=LCS(empty,s2)=empty</TT>.

<P>

A straightforward recursive implementation of this definition would be
unusable, but a dynamic programming implementation should run in
quadratic time.  This is because for input strings <TT>s1</TT> and
<TT>s2</TT>, we need to complete a table with
<TT>length(s1)*length(s2)</TT> entries, where each entry requires us
to examine three previously computed entries and some simple
arithmetic.

<P><HR><CENTER><H3>Requirements</H3></CENTER>

You will write a class <TT>LCS</TT> in the file <TT>LCS.java</TT> with
the method:
<PRE>
    public static String findLCS(String s1, String s2)
</PRE>
that will find a longest common subsequence of two strings.  It should
run in less than ten seconds for strings up to length 100.  Your code
must work with my test file.  Also include a brief
<TT>README.txt</TT> file.

<P><HR><CENTER><H3>Submission and Grading</H3></CENTER>

Submit your work to the CourseWeb site for this course.  If you cannot
complete the entire project you can still receive 5 points if your
method returns an <TT>int</TT> that is the length of an LCS of the
arguments.
