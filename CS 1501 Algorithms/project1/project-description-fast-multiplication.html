<P><HR><CENTER><H3>Introduction</H3></CENTER>

We are all familiar with basic arithmetic on integers.  The standard
algorithms we learned in elementary school work well for most
applications.  However, conventional multiplication can be slow
(quadratic) for very large integers.  Applications, such as
cryptography, that perform arithmetic on integers with hundreds or
thousands of digits typically multiply integers using a <EM>Fast
Multiplication</EM> algorithm.  In this project, you will implement
several of the simple school algorithms, plus <EM>Karatsuba-Ofman
Multiplication</EM>, for very large integers.

<P><HR><CENTER><H3>Requirements</H3></CENTER>

You will implement a class of huge integers (with potentially several
thousand decimal digits) in the class:
<UL>
  <LI><TT>public class HugeInteger implements Comparable&lt;HugeInteger&gt;</TT>
</UL>
Implement the following methods:
<UL>
  <LI><TT>public HugeInteger(String s)</TT>
      constructs a new <TT>HugeInteger</TT> object.
  <LI><TT>public int compareTo(HugeInteger h)</TT>
      compares <TT>this</TT> to <TT>h</TT>.
  <LI><TT>public HugeInteger add(HugeInteger h)</TT>
      adds <TT>this</TT> and <TT>h</TT>.
  <LI><TT>public HugeInteger subtract(HugeInteger h)</TT>
      subtracts <TT>h</TT> from <TT>this</TT>.
      Assumes <TT>h</TT> is not larger than <TT>this</TT>.
  <LI><TT>public HugeInteger multiply(HugeInteger h)</TT>
      multiplies <TT>this</TT> and <TT>h</TT> using the school algorithm.
  <LI><TT>public HugeInteger fastMultiply(HugeInteger x)</TT>
      multiplies <TT>this</TT> and <TT>h</TT> using Karatsuba-Ofman
      multiplication.
  <LI><TT>public String toString()</TT> is used for printing.
</UL>
Assume all huge integers are nonnegative.  Your methods should
be nondestructive, so <TT>this</TT> and <TT>h</TT> are not changed.

<P>

Include a static variable to count primitive arithmetic operations:
<UL>
  <LI><TT>public static int DIGIT_OPERATIONS</TT>
</UL>
You can count single-digit additions, subtractions, comparisons, and
multiplications, or use the number of digit-accesses in an array as a
proxy.

<P>

Your <TT>HugeInteger</TT> class should work with my test file with
similar performance.  That is, your operation counts should display
the same asymptotic behavior as mine, and your code should run no
slower than my code (and a factor of five).  Be sure to include a
<TT>README.txt</TT> file with your submission.
