INTRODUCTION

This program implements a dynamic programming algorithm for the
cloth-cutting problem.

INSTALLATION

The following files should be present:

  ClothCutter.java
  Cloth.java
  Cut.java
  Garment.java
  Pattern.java
  TestClothCutter.java

Compile and test with Java 2.1.5 or later:

  javac TestClothCutter.java
  java TestClothCutter


USAGE

See TestClothCutter.java for an example of usage.
I chose to make my program very similar to his, in the sense
that I made all of my class files compatibile with his test program.

PROBLEMS

No known problems- I think I nailed it!
