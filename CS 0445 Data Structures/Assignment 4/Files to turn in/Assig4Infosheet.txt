My program compiles without errors. 

Additional comments/Extra credit:
I implemented the three different data orders in their own class, each of which extends 'Assig4ableAbstract.' This allowed me to simply call array.fill(), array.getOrder(), etc, and have the proper method be executed, all from an Assig4ableAbstract array. I think that this is both good style and in line with what we have been learning all year.
