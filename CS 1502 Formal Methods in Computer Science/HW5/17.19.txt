Problem 17.19

We need to make all five sentences true:
Start by assigning true to Cube(a) [sentence 2] and Large(e) [sentence 4].
Then we know that -Large(e) v -Cube(a) is false, so Tet(f) must be true [sentence 1].
Then we know that -Tet(f) v -Large(e) is false, so Small(d) must be true [sentence 3].
But then -Cube(a) v -Large(e) v -Small(d) is false, and can not be made true.
We are done, since it is impossible to make all five sentences true.
