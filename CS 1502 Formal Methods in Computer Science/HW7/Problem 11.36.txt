Problem 11.36

In the following problems, I use this notation:
->  for implication
v   for disjunction
^   for conjunction
~   for negation
<-> for biconditional
A   for universal quantifier
E   for existential quantifier

Question:
(P -> Ex Q) <-> (Ex [P -> Q])

Solution:
P -> Ex Q 			 This is what we start with
~P v Ex Q        By replacing the ->
Ex (~P v Q)			 Since x is not free in P
Ex [P -> Q]			 By re-inserting the ->

Thus (Ex P -> Q) <-> (Ax[P -> Q]).
