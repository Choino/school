Problem 11.34

In the following problems, I use this notation:
->  for implication
v   for disjunction
^   for conjunction
~   for negation
<-> for biconditional
A   for universal quantifier
E   for existential quantifier

Question:
(Ex P -> Q) <-> (Ax[P -> Q])

Solution:
Ex P -> Q 			 This is what we start with
~(Ex P) v Q      By replacing the ->
Ax ~P v Q     	 By distributing the ~
Ax (~P v Q) 		 Since x is not free in Q

Thus (Ex P -> Q) <-> (Ax[P -> Q]).
