Exercise 6.27

Informal Proof:

	Between the two disjunctions, there are four possible combinations of conjunctions which are true. Consider the four combinations one by one

	1. (A ^ B) ^ (B ^ C)
	2. (A ^ B) ^ (D ^ E)
	3. (C ^ D) ^ (B ^ C)
	4. (C ^ D) ^ (D ^ E)

	in case one, C is true, so C v (A ^ E) is true.
	in case two, A ^ E is true, so C v (A ^ E) is true.
	in case three, C is true, so C v (A ^ E) is true.
	in case four, C is true, so C v (A ^ E) is true.

	Thus in any of the four combinations, the premsies imply the conclusion.
