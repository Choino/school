Steps:

FIRST MAKE THE INIT SCRIPT
//init.php
//	- What kind of schema?
//	- Users : stores the username, email, password, wins, losses as before
//	- CurrentlyLogged : for each user
//			- Their user id
//			- The state of the game they're currently in
//	- State : for each game being played
//			- Which person is maker, which is guesser
/*			- Correct word: Max of 16 chars
//			- Incorrect guesses (number)
//			- List of guessed letters
//			- Current word	


THEN MAKE THE FLAT FILES
users.txt

THEN MAKE THE LOGIN SCRIPT

Maybe slight modification of login.php from last time, because our schema may be slightly different

HAVE LOGGING IN INSERT THE USER INTO CurrentlyLogged
Display our full schema to make sure

HAVE LOGGING IN A SECOND USER PAIR HIM WITH THE FIRST
Make sure to not pair with yourself
Make sure to delete once finished


HAVE THE FIRST USER WAIT FOR THE SECOND, THEN BOTH ENTERED INTO THE GAME
done

GET THE SINGLE SET OF XML TAGS IN PLACE AS A STRUCTURE TO DISPLAY TO BOTH USERS
	- Same tags for both users, different content inside
	- See ramirez's files

ACTUALLY START GENERATING AND PARSING DIFFERENT XML PER USER	
done

BIG STRUCTURE
	- First wait until CurrentWord != ''
		- Guesser gets a waiting screen
		- Maker gets a input field
		

THEN COME BACK HERE AND WRITE MORE
