     Use a form to collect a query against the cars
     database.

NOTE:
     In fact, the script called by this file gives unrestricted access
     to the database since any query could be entered here.  Thus, I have
     added an id and password field to it.  Only you should know the
     password for your database.  Generally, arbitrary queries to a database
     by the end user will NOT be allowed.

     Call the PHP script access_cars.php to perform
     the given query and display the results
     -->
<html>
<head><title> Access to the cars database </title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
Please enter your query:
<br />
<form action  = "access_cars.php" method = "post">
    <textarea  rows = "2"  cols = "80" name = "query" ></textarea>
    <br /><br />
    MySql Id: <input type = "text" name = "id"/><br />
    Password: <input type = "password" name = "pass"/><br />
    <input type = "reset"  value = "Reset" />
    <input type = "submit"  value = "Submit request" />
</form>
