  # Note here that we are using the value of the $_POST variable "slot"
  # to determine which quote was selected.  If the user has chosen the checkbox
  # for "Add New Quote", the other POST variables are processed and the new 
  # quote is added to the file.  Whether a new quote is added or not, the
  # selected quote (from the radiobutton) is written in  bold italic and in
  # full, and some extra information is written after the table.

  # Note the use of stripslashes below.  When data is entered on a form, some
  # special characters (ex: ') are identified with backslashes so as not to
  # cause any problems (ex: with databases).  Since we are just using a text
  # file here we will strip them off
  
  # I also replace all | symbols with null strings so that the user cannot
  # mess up the formatting by entering | in the data.  Finally I strip the
  # tags as another precaution.  However, there may still be a way that the
  # malicious user can cause problems.  In general you should be EXTREMELY
  # CAREFUL any time you allow the user to enter arbitrary data in a form.
  # Giving users limited choices (ex: through lists, checkboxes and radio-
  # buttons) is generally much safer.

  # the middle of a write when file() is called, we could get some bad data
