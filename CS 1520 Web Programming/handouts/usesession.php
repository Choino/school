# Script using sessions and cookies to maintain state information.
# Repeat users are detected using a cookie.  Once the user is in, a
# session is used to keep track of the state.  The user has a simple
# menu of options, all using the same script file.  Note that the
# session will work across different php scripts as well. 

# Start a session and a test a session variable to indicate if a user is
# just logging in or is already been using the site.  By default sessions
# in PHP are implemented using cookies -- however, you will note that they
# are much easier to use than cookies. The $_SESSION array is where
# session variables are stored during a script execution -- between
# executions they are stored on the server -- only a session id is stored
# on the client.
#
# Cookies are also used directly in this handout.  If a cookie for the
# server exists on the client, the client has visited this site before.
# In this way we can recognize previous clients.  Recall that cookies must
# be passed to the client with the http header -- before any of the actual
# html.  The setcookie() function sets up the cookie to be sent, as
# long as it is called before any of the html tags have been
# processed.

# Since by default sessions use cookies, and since cookies must be passed
# with the HTTP Header, you need to start a session BEFORE any HTML tags in
# your code.
session_start();

// Time zone is needed for the date() function used below
date_default_timezone_set('America/New_York');

$option = $_SESSION['option'];
$info = $_COOKIE['zany'];

# The 'option' session variable is used to store the type of operation
# that the server will perform.  It has 2 possible values:
# 'info' -- On the next execution the server will process contact
#           information submitted by the user.  This option is only set
#           for a new user when first logging in
# 'choice' -- On the next execution the server will process a menu choice
#             value entered by the user
# If 'option' is not set at all, this means that the user is not
# currently in an active session -- so set up the session variables
# appropriately.

   if (strcmp($option,'info')== 0)   # so store it in the session and

           # keyed array.  On the client this is actually multiple cookies
           # but through PHP we can access it as a single array.
           # The expiration time is 600 seconds in the future,
           # or 10 minutes.  Note that this script does not re-register the
           # cookie with successive logins once it has been created. Thus,
           # after 10 minutes from the initial login, if a user logs out
           # and in again, the cookie will have expired and he/she will have
           # to re-enter the information.
