   # 1) I could have put a hyperlink in ex17b.php directly to ex17.php
   #    rather than using the redirection shown here.  However, I added this
   #    to demonstrate redirection.  
   # 2) If used, redirection must be done PRIOR to any html (same idea as
   #    setting cookies)
   # 3) This redirection is done prior to testing any session variables
   #    so technically a user could access this redirect without going
   #    through ex17b.php.  However, illegal accesses should redirect to
   #    the main page, and this is what is done here anyway, so it is not
   #    a problem.
