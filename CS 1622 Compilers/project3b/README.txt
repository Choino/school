Build Instructions:
	1. Open the zip folder, then open the Makefile within.
	2. Adjust the paths (PWD and JARPATH) for the directory you are running in, and the directory of 'java-cup-11a.jar'.
	3. Adjust the RUN_FILE to the input file you would like to test on.
	4. Type 'make'

Other notes:
	I have tested this program with a.txt, b.txt, â€¦, e.txt, and a number of smaller programs along the way. I am confident it performs as it should.
