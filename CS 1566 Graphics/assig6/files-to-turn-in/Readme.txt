Known bugs (if any): 
	- None!

Extra credit (describe what you did, if any):
	- None!

Comments:  
	- I included ray_spec (the default spec file given to us, with the camera moved back), which matches with ray_spec.jpg
	- Also included ray_spec2 and ray_spec2.jpg, which is just a slight color alteration that I thought looked pretty nifty.
	- I'm happy with how fast my code runs (on my lousy laptop with integrated graphics).
	- I am turning this in a day early! Woohoo!
	- It doesn't look exactly like your sample image, but I think it's close enough.
	- Time to really get rolling on the final project!
