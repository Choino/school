zps6_1:

'qALOkANiONTVajBUqPMgnZsX'

was the password. I found this by doing basically the same thing as we did in the Puzzle Lab. I thought that strcmp was a good place to look if the password was just a string of ascii characters, and it worked. I did disas at main, then set a breakpoint at the strcmp location, then did x/s (char *)0x8090b08, just as in the lab, to see the string being given to the strcmp call.





zps6_2:

3.141593

was the password. I found this by first disas main, then after noticing the call to '<d>', doing disas c, d, e, and s. Each time I did x/s (char *)$eax, $ebx, $esp, $esi, until I found some strings that looked promising. Eventually I stumbled upon 3.141593
