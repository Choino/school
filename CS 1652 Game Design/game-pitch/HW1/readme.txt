Known bugs (if any): 
	- Couldn't get textures working properly.
	- Couldn't figure out how to select individual objects- just 'an' object.

Extra credit (describe what you did, if any):
	- None!

Controls:
	- Arrow keys to pan left and right and zoom in and out (camera controls)
  - Click on the screen to see if you selected a shape (and see the message 'Got one' in the top left), or nothing (and see 'no selection')

Comments:
	- This project was pretty rough. I had a lot of trouble getting anything to run properly, and had to reinstall a few times before I figured out how to compile and run. Very frustrating at first.
	- I used Xcode for the first time, so I'm not 100% positive what to send. I'm going to send the two source code files, plus the xcode project, but I really doubt it will run unless you run it from the GeometricTools/WildMagic/SampleGraphics/Lights folder.
	- Obviously, Wild Magic is going to take a long time to learn how to play nicely with it and figure out where it hides all its secrets. I'm not happy at all with the results of this homework, but I'm just submitting now and hoping to move on.
