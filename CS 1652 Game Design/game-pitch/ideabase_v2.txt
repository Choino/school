HW3: IDEABASE version 2

(Ideas marked with ****** ****** are ones I think are particularly interesting, easy to pull off, or would be very entertaining)


1. ****** Coded Reality ****** - Black and white puzzle game where you can 'peek behind the scenes' and alter the game's code to solve the puzzles. Teaches basic programming and analytical skills.

6. Alien vs. Anchorman - A misogynistic 60s newscaster faces down an alien race of feminists.
7. Flight 1984 - Think Desert Bus. Board an airplane that turns out to be a floating propaganda machine for the world-state in 1984.

10. This is a Game - Much like Demetri Martin's book, this game would be a very ironic, meta, self-aware game about game conventions and the tropes we're all aware of. Think DLC Quest.
11. ****** This is Not a Game ****** - The total opposite of the previous one. Still very self-aware of gaming conventions and tropes, but plays with the user's gaming knowledge and gives unexpected results.
12. Microsoft Flight (attendant) Simulator - Deal with needy passengers, comply with federal regulations, and try to expedite the boarding and exiting procedures.

24. Diabetes Detective - Use clues like 'checking the trash can' and 'keeping an inventory on the fridge' to determine what your diabetic girlfriend has been eating and what her blood sugar is probably like. The nosier you are, the better you're doing!

38. Philosophy Wars - Rationalists vs Empiricists, Platonic vs Aristotelian, Skeptic vs. Gnostic, this fighting game pits famous philosophers from all eras against each other.
